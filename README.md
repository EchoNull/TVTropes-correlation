TVTropes-correlation
====================

Look at two works and determine how similar they are in terms of the tropes they use

To start, follow the new movie link from the home page.
Input a TVTropes URL for a movie (or other media).
(Note: If the tropes are in subfolders, they will not be detected.)

The movie and its trope set are then scraped from TVTropes.org.

Each movie's page lists up to 5 movies with the most similar trope sets.
